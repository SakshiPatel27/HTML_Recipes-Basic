    <h1>MOMOS</h1>
    <img src="C:\Users\Saksh\Desktop\HTML_Recipes\Recipes\momos.jpg" alt="It's healthy momos" height="350" width="350">
    <p>Momos are a type of <strong>dumpling </strong>popular in South Asian cuisine, particularly in Nepal, 
        Tibet, and parts of India.These bite-sized treats consist of a dough wrapper
         filled with a savory mixture, which can include vegetables, minced meat, or 
         cheese. The dumplings are typically steamed, though they can also be fried or 
         boiled.</p>
    <p>Momos are often served with a spicy dipping sauce, such as a tangy tomato 
        chutney or a spicy chili sauce. They are enjoyed as a snack, appetizer, 
        or part of a meal and are loved for their delicate, flavorful filling and 
        soft, chewy exterior.</p>
