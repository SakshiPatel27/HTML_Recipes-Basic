    <p>Aloo Paratha is a popular Indian flatbread stuffed with a spiced <em>potato filling </em>. 
        The dough, made from whole wheat flour, is rolled out and filled with a mixture of 
        mashed potatoes, onions, and a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala. 
        The stuffed dough is then rolled into a flatbread and cooked on a griddle with a bit of 
        oil or ghee until crispy and golden brown. Itâ€™s often enjoyed with yogurt, pickles, or a 
        dollop of butter and is a staple in <strong>Punjab</strong> North Indian cuisine.</p>

        <h3>Assembling and Cooking:</h3>
        <li>Divide the Dough and Filling:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Divide the Dough and Filling:</li>

            <li>Gently bring the edges of the dough around the filling to enclose it completely, pinching the edges together to seal.</li>
            <li>Flatten the stuffed dough ball slightly and roll it out into a larger circle, being careful not to let the filling spill out.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Paratha:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
